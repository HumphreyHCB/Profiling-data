Handful of things

Tried to make a pointlessNode change to a complex structure using pre-existing and VirtualStackSlot.
But instead Wrote a new"pointless node that has nothing to do with the stack pointer. It seems to work, but it doesn't help the wider issue.

I converted the Upos Table into a JSON file I can use.
I tried using its data instead for full runsâ€”no luck.


Wrote it so it can take cost files dynamically.
I attempted to do benchmark-specific data collections, focusing on Queens. I found that if I made LIR costs really specific to the method of benchmarks,but still nothing major working

Intel VTune, for benchmarks like Queens, shows different results compared to non-slowdown runs. when compared to async


I wrote a raw ASM inject slowdown,
 but using the old costs caused little to no slowdown, 
and using the new costs caused too much slowdown, and making the async resulsts be just wrong.
