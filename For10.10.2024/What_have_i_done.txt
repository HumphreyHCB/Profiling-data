Handful of things
I converted the Upos Table into json file i can use

I tryed using its data isntead for full runs 
no luck 

I tryed to do Benchmark spersfic data collections
focused on Queensfound if i made Lir Cost reall spserfif to method of benchmaks
would that work
NO!

Wrote a new pointless that does nothign to do with stack pointer, seems to work bit does not help the wider issue

IntelVtune dose for bencmaks like queens have diffrent resulsts from a non slowdown runs


i wrote a Raw ASM inject slowdown, but using the oldCOst cause little to know slowdown, and using the new cost cause too mucha nd the awnsers are just wrong
